# FacemaskDetection
As there are growing number of restrictions that have to be followed when it comes to wearing a face mask, we as a team thought this project will be apt in order to recognise or detect if someone is wearing a facemask or otherwise. It can be used in places like offices, schools, hospitals, cabs and all other public places. The model that we have used is a simple CNN model with 9 layers and 10 epochs gave a validation accuracy of 97.42%

DataSet:
The dataset was acquired from several online sources like Kaggle which contains two folders "Train" and "Test", the "train" folder consits of 1314 images and the "Test" folder consists of 194 Images, of human beings wearing a mask and another set without masks to train the python classifier.
